<figcaption>Lake Michigan and The Point</figcaption>
</center></figure>

This photo was taken at the Point during the summer 2012. One benefit of having a lake only ten minutes away is that we can just walk to the Point on a nice day, take couples photos and walk back. Sometimes it is pretty hard to believe that something beautiful like this is really close to where we live.
