<figcaption>X-Flight: The newest ride in Six Flag Great America</figcaption>
</center></figure>

 "X-Flight"is the newest ride at Six Flag Great America in Illinois and also the first Wing Coaster in the United States. It quickly becomes one of the most promising rides in the park.
 $20 for Six Flag trip is one great thing for this summer in Chicago. I really enjoy my first Six Flag trip and look forward to going more. We rode in total 10 rides within 7 hours without any break. I felt little dizzy after riding about 5 rides, but I could not stop riding more. It was really fun. :)
