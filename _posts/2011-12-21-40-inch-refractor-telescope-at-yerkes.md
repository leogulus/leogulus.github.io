I went to the [Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin](http://leogulus-champ.blogspot.com/2011/12/yerkes-observatory.html) with Astronomy Club. The observatory is owned by University of Chicago since the school was very new before 1900. This 40-inch refracting telescope easily became the largest telescope at that time and still the biggest refracting telescope in the world now that still exist today.

After more than 100 years of working hard as an important tool to discover the universe, it now has a new role as an educator to teach kids about astronomy. Good luck Yerkes.
