This is one of the masterpiece of Vincent van Gogh in the Art Institution of Chicago in Chicago, IL. There are more than you can imagine in this museum. If you have a chance to come to Chicago, don't forget to visit this museum which is right next to the Millennium Park.

**Update**: I had a chance to visit Vatican Museum while I am studying abroad in Paris during my third year of college. I saw another great paintings by van Gogh. This one is Pietà which, they said, is the only painting for van Gogh relating to religion and Christianity.
