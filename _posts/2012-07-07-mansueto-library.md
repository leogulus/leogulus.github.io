This photo is one of my favorite photos that I have taken. Outsider might think that this is a spacecraft or some sort of alien aircrafts while students might just enjoy studying here during final exams. But it is something more than a reading space for students or a spaceship for others. Underneath this building is a solution of how we keep all books until UChicago’s libraries become one of the libraries with the most books in the country. The solution is "Robotic Cranes”
<div>     Thousands of books lies underneath this building and robotic cranes help carrying those books up to the surface for people who want them. The software has to be very precise otherwise we will not be able to find them among other thousands books underground. That is how crazy this crazy-looking building is.</div>
