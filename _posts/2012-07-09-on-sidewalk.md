This photo doesn't have a lot of details in it. It just a photo of some building in downtown Chicago that reflected the water near a sidewalk. It was a cloudy day and rain just left us. I was about to cross the street but then the light turned red and  we have to wait for the light. I looked down and saw some reflection from a little pond in front of me. I took my camera out and quickly snapped this shot before we actually crossed the street. It wasn't that excited moment for this shot, but I still like this one.
"Sometimes your achievement will come when you do not expect it to come. But if you don't prepare, all those successes will leave you behind and found another person who are prepared. So, be prepared for unexpecting thing to come"
