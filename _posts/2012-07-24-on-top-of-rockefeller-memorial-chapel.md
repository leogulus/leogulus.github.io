Rockefeller Memorial Chapel is one of the most interesting building on campus at the University of Chicago with a single tall tower. I always wish that I have a chance to climb up to the top of the tower.
Finally, that chance did come to me during the summer. I went to the top of the tower and was amazed by the scene of Downtown Chicago from this far away. The Willis tower is the main focus of this view unlike the scene near the lake that Willis tower is often at the left side of the photo, emphasizing how spectacular this building is.

The photo also captures a sculpture of Thomas Ã  Kempis, a canon regular of the late medieval period, located at the West side of the tower.
