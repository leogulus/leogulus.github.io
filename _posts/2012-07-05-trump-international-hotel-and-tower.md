"Trump International Hotel and Tower" or Trump Tower  is a cool nice-looking building close to Chicago river and Michigan Avenue Bridge. We will see this building every time we went to a movie theater until one day someone told me the name of the building "Trump Tower." I found more cool thing about this building which is that it is the second-tallest building in the United States while the tallest one, Willis Tower, is also in Chicago. It is even taller than Empire States Building in New York City and it was actually planned to be the tallest building in the world. However after 9/11, everyone revised the plan and made it more safety and shorter than it was planned, so that it will be less targeted from terrorists.
