The weather that day was pretty bad. Snow storm came to Chicago, but some people were excited about this because they all think that this should be time for snow and winter to come to Chicago eventually. January without the whiteness of snow isn't something familiar here at all. However, less than a week after this, all snow was melt and everything become green again as if the winter will never come this year. Everyone still wait for winter, so that they will enjoy spring much more.
