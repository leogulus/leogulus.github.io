<figcaption>Downtown Chicago from the Point</figcaption>

Downtown Chicago from the Point is one of my favorite view in Hype Park (where UChicago is located). The Promontory Point is a man-made peninsula into Lake Michigan. During the summer, a lot of people will come and make BBQ here while others will enjoy the beach which is nearby the Point.  Downtown from this point is fantastic. You can see (from the left) a Willis (Sears) tower as the tallest building in the United States, Trump Tower as a second-tallest building, John Hancock Center and Lake Point Tower at the furtherest one to the right.
