One of my goal that I went to Los Angeles during winter break'12 is to go the Griffith Observatory. The telescope is not actually huge, but the location of it is pretty good. Right next to Hollywood sign is a good spot of tourists. As you can see from this photo, a lot people came here and just wait to get a nice shot from sun set which is actually pretty cool. We might not be able to call it an observatory because no one has used it for any kind of research. I think we should call it "astronomical museum" instead.
