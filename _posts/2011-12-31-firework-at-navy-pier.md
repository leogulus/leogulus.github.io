What are you doing on the last day of the year 2011. My friend (Nut) and I went to Navy Pier for the first time to watch a firework. It was really cold outside, so we spent most of the time inside Navy Pier until the firework started. The crowds was crazy. And we have to walk all the way to 6th bus stop to get back to our apartment. It might not be the best way to spend my last day of a year, but it was worth trying for the first time (maybe not for the next time though).
