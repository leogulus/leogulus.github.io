### About me

My name is Taweewat Somboonpanyakul, but most people just call me "Champ" which
is my "official" nickname, not just a English nickname that I came up for myself.
I was born and raised in Bangkok, Thailand (some people might know it from [The Hangover Part II](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_hangover_2/), but I can tell know that not all Bangkok is like that).
I enjoy traveling to different places that I have never been before. I also like to learn historise of those places so that I can appreciate each location more while taking photos of them in order to remember those moments better.

PS. Feel free to email me anything at my email address: leogulus at gmail dot com

### Education

I graduated high school once from Thailand at [Mahidol Wittayanusorn School (MWITS)](https://www.mwit.ac.th/mwit-eng/) before moving to North Carolina at [Asheville School](http://www.ashevilleschool.org/) to study my senior year again while doing college application. Then, I got in University of Chicago where I am studying physics as an undergraduate student.

As an undergraduate student who major in physics, I spent my last two summer working in an astrophysics lab. My first research assistant job in the summer was working about Gravitational Lensing. It is the first evidence that proved 'general relativity' developed by Albert Einstein is correct. My main topic for this research is to test the ability of find such a gravitational lensing using technique that my professor developed by creating fake arcs and see how completely we can find these fake ones. My second and current research topic is about exoplanet which is just became famous less than twenty years. We work with data from [Kepler Space Telescope](http://kepler.nasa.gov/), but unfortunately [the mission seemed to be stopped indefinitely](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23550-kepler-telescopes-planet-hunting-days-crunch-to-a-close/#.UcvCEj7wKT4) due to technical problems on the telescope. My main topic is planets around short period binary stars. In addition, for my senior thesis for undergraduate study, I am studying circumgalactic medium using background quasars in group environment. From this project, I had some experience using spectrum in the optical (for composition of circumgalactic medium surrounding nearby galaxies) and UV (for absorption line from background QSOs) range.

I am currently at MIT in the Physics PhD program (started in 2015) with a focus on Astrophysics. My current project is in identifying and studying the properties of galaxy clusters which host active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the middle. I am working mostly with optical (with Magellan) and X-ray (with Chandra). My current advisor is [Prof. Michael McDonald](http://space.mit.edu/~mcdonald/).

### Why I'm Here

This website is acted as my personal portfolio for what I have done in terms of academics with my Astrophysics researches, and my other interests including data visualization and my volunteering works.

Whereas the blog is recorded my past experience chronologically. The focus for the blog will be mostly on traveling and visiting different places (for both business and pleasure trips). Occasionally, it will also be used to show case my previous data visualization projects and rarely announcing some scientific discoveries.

In the end, this is just a place for me to write something down and kept it as my personal journal that I will enjoy once I looked back at these post years later.
