### About me
My name is Taweewat Somboonpanyakul. I was born and raised in Bangkok, Thailand. I really enjoy traveling, especially to new places with new cultures. I also like to learn about their history, so that I can appreciate each location.

### Education

I went to high school in Thailand at [Mahidol Wittayanusorn School (MWITS)](https://www.mwit.ac.th/mwit-eng/) before moving to North Carolina to [Asheville School](http://www.ashevilleschool.org/) to finish my senior year. Then, I got into University of Chicago where I studied physics as an undergraduate student.

As an undergraduate student, I spent my first two summer working in astrophysics labs. My first research project was working on strong gravitational lensing. It was one of the first evidence, which proved 'general relativity'. My main topic for that project was to test the ability of find such gravitational lensings by creating fake arcs and seeing how completely we can detect these arcs. My second topic was about transiting exoplanet which is just became famous less than twenty years. We work with data from [Kepler Space Telescope](http://kepler.nasa.gov/), but unfortunately [the mission seemed to be stopped indefinitely](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23550-kepler-telescopes-planet-hunting-days-crunch-to-a-close/#.UcvCEj7wKT4) due to technical problems on the telescope. My main topic is planets around short period binary stars. In addition, for my senior thesis for undergraduate study, I am studying circumgalactic medium using background quasars in group environment. From this project, I had some experience using spectrum in the optical (for composition of circumgalactic medium surrounding nearby galaxies) and UV (for absorption line from background QSOs) range.

I am currently at MIT in the Physics PhD program (started in 2015) with a focus on Astrophysics. My current project is in identifying and studying the properties of galaxy clusters which host active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the middle. I am working mostly with optical (with Magellan) and X-ray (with Chandra). My current advisor is [Prof. Michael McDonald](http://space.mit.edu/~mcdonald/).

### Why I'm Here

This website is acted as my personal portfolio for what I have done in terms of academics with my Astrophysics researches, and my other interests including data visualization and my volunteering works.

Whereas the blog is recorded my past experience chronologically. The focus for the blog will be mostly on traveling and visiting different places (for both business and pleasure trips). Occasionally, it will also be used to show case my previous data visualization projects and rarely announcing some scientific discoveries.

In the end, this is just a place for me to write something down and kept it as my personal journal that I will enjoy once I looked back at these post years later.
