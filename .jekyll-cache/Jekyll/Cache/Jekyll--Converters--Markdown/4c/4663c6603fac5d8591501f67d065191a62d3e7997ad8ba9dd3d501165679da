<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://astrogazers.mit.edu/">MKI Astrogazers</a></strong><br />
We are an outreach group of graduate students mostly in the MIT astrophysics division. We take telescopes around the Cambridge/Boston area to show the cosmos to the public. We also have a solar telescope for daytime observing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://astro.uchicago.edu/RAS/">The Ryerson Astronomical Society</a></strong><br />
I served as a President for the Ryerson Astronomical Society in college from 2012-2014. The main goal for the club is to organize public viewing to observe celestial objects on the roof of our building.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://communitycamp.weebly.com/index.html">Community Camp</a></strong><br />
My other interest is about volunteering and education. This website is an example for student camps that I have previously organized and documents related to these activities so that others would be able to do a similar project.</p>
