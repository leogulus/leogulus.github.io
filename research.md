### The Clusters Hiding in Plain Sight (*CHiPS*) survey
<figure><center>
  <img width="800" src="/images/chips_01.png"/>
  <figcaption>The top three panels show color-color diagrams for objects that are detected in all catalogs (3408 objects). The axes are the logarithm of the ratio of the X-Ray, mid-infrared (MIR) or radio flux to the near-infrared (NIR) flux. The bottom three panels show potential galaxy cluster candidates (561 objects) based on our chosen color-color cuts. We remove background (z > 0.7) and foreground (z < 0.1) sources from our sample based on redshift information from NED. The Phoenix and Perseus clusters are shown with orange and green boxes, respectively, while our first confirmed cluster is shown in yellow.</figcaption>

I am interested in identifying nearby galaxy clusters (z~0.2-0.7) with QSO dominant at the center, which have been mislabeled simply as a QSO in X-ray all-sky survey. One example of this misidentified galaxy cluster is the [*Phoenix Cluster*](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012Natur.488..349M) (McDonald et al 2012), discovered recently using the Sunyaevâ€“Zel'dovich effect with [the South Pole Telescope](https://pole.uchicago.edu/). This leads us to question of how many of these nearby galaxy cluster we have been mislabeled in existing all-sky surveys.
