## The Clusters Hiding in Plain Sight (*CHiPS*) survey
<figure><center>
  <img width="800" src="/images/chips01.png"/>
  <figcaption>The top three panels show color-color diagrams for objects that are detected in all four all-sky surveys (4,206 objects). The axes are the logarithm of the ratio of the X-Ray, mid-IR (MIR) or radio flux to the near-IR (NIR) flux. Points color in pink satisfy our three color cuts. The bottom three panels zoom in on these potential galaxy cluster candidates (735 objects). We remove the background (z > 0.7) and foreground (z < 0.1) sources from our sample based on redshift information from NED. The Phoenix, Perseus (NGC 1275), and Abell 1835 clusters, which host extreme BCGs, are shown with purple, red and green squares, respectively while PKS1353-341 is shown with a blue square.</figcaption>

I am interested in identifying nearby galaxy clusters (z~0.2-0.7) with QSO dominant at the center, which have been mislabeled simply as a QSO in previous X-ray all-sky survey, such as ROSAT. One example of this misidentified galaxy cluster is the [*Phoenix Cluster*](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012Natur.488..349M) (McDonald et al 2012), discovered recently using the Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect with [the South Pole Telescope](https://pole.uchicago.edu/). This leads us to question of how many of these nearby galaxy cluster we have been mislabeled in existing all-sky surveys.

### First Galaxy Cluster from the *CHIPS* Survey: Galaxy Cluster surrounding PKS1353-341

Our first newly discovered low-redshift (z = 0.223) galaxy cluster with a central X-ray bright point source, PKS1353-341 is presented here. The cluster has mass that are 700 trillions more than the mass of the sun or ~1200 times more massive than our Milky Way. The cluster hosts the extreme active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the center of the cluster which ejects enourmous energy to heat up its surrounding gas.
