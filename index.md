Welcome to my website! I am a Kavli Postdoctoral Fellow at [the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology](https://kipac.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. This is a space for me to share my research and my interests.

For research, I am studying galaxy clusters, often called the largest and most massive gravitationally bound objects in the universe. [My main interests](research.md) is focused on finding and characterizing galaxy clusters with extreme properties (e.g., starburst-hosting or active blackhole-hosting galaxies). I have discovered a new galaxy cluster, CHIPS1911+4455, which hosts one of the highest star-formation-rate galaxies in the center.
