I am a graduate student in [the Physics Department](http://web.mit.edu/physics/) and [Kavli Institute](http://space.mit.edu/) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is my personal website about the my research and my interests.

For research, I am studying galaxy clusters, often called the largest and most massive gravitationally bound objects in the universe. My main project for the PhD thesis is [the Cluster Hiding in Plain Sight (CHiPS) Survey](research.md), which has a goal to find and quantify galaxy clusters hosting extreme central galaxies (starbursts and/or quasars).
