I am a graduate student in the Physics Department and Kavli Institute at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is my professional website about the my research and my interests.

I study galaxy clusters and my current project is identifying Phoenix-like clusters through cross-correlating all-sky survey datas, including ROSAT (X-ray), 2MASS (Near IR), WISE, (Mid IR), NVSS/SUMSS (Radio).
