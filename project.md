## My Data Visualization Projects
- [Jupyter notebook showing about MIT Astrophysics Alunmi in terms of their careers (current upto 2013)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/leogulus/Datavisualization/blob/master/mit_alumni/mit_alumni.ipynb?flush_cache=true)
- [Diagram showing money providede by various funding agencies in the US in 2013 to the top 100 universities](/extra_webpage/funding1.html)
- **UPDATE!!** [Diagram showing no correlation between Physics GRE scores and GPA or General GRE quantitative section](/extra_webpage/fig.html)

### Specifically about Astrophysics
- **NEW!!** [Diagram showing the Chandra proposal time accepted from 1999-2015](/extra_webpage/chandra_line_plot.html).
- [Diagram showing the average seeing at Magellan telescope from March 1st, 2017 to June 22nd, 2017](/extra_webpage/seeing.pdf). Note: one second seeing is relative good for ground-based telescope.
- [Diagram showing the average wind speed at Magellan telescope from March 1st, 2017 to June 22nd, 2017](/extra_webpage/seeing.pdf). Note: 35 mph is the cut-off for the telescope that we have to close the dome and stop observing because high wind can potentially damage the mirror.

## My Volunteer/Outreach Works
- **[Community Camp](http://communitycamp.weebly.com/index.html)**\\
  My another interests is about volunteering and education. This website is an example for student camps that I previously organized and documents related to these activities so that others would be able to do a similar project.

## My Blog
- **[My Blog](http://leogulus-champ.blogspot.com/)** \\
  My personal blog is where I posted mostly about my travel experience, my academic experience with talks and previous conferences, and other non-academic interests like data visualization and geographic information system (GIS).
