## My Data Visualization Projects
- [Number of Students in each Departments for the Faculty of Science in Thai Universities in 2020](/extra_webpage/science_faculty_plot.html)
- [Number of Students in Thai Universities from 2016-2020](/extra_webpage/Thai_university_population.html)
- [Diagrams showing changes in Bangkok population from 2009 to 2016](/extra_webpage/bangkok_pop/index.html)
- [Jupyter notebook showing about MIT Astrophysics Alunmi in terms of their careers (current upto 2013)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/leogulus/Datavisualization/blob/master/mit_alumni/mit_alumni.ipynb?flush_cache=true)
- [Diagram showing money providede by various funding agencies in the US in 2013 to the top 100 universities](/extra_webpage/funding1.html)
- [Diagram showing no correlation between Physics GRE scores and GPA or General GRE quantitative section](/extra_webpage/fig.html)

### Specifically about Astrophysics
- [Diagram showing the Chandra proposal time accepted from 1999-2020](/extra_webpage/chandra_line_plot.html).
- [Hand-made Sundial for Students](/extra_webpage/sundial_n.pdf)
- [Diagram showing average seeing at the Magellan telescope between 2018 and 2019](/extra_webpage/seeing_boken.html).
- [Diagram showing the average seeing at Magellan telescope from March 1st, 2017 to June 22nd, 2017](/extra_webpage/seeing.pdf). Note: one second seeing is relative good for ground-based telescope.
- [Diagram showing the average wind speed at Magellan telescope from March 1st, 2017 to June 22nd, 2017](/extra_webpage/seeing.pdf). Note: 35 mph is the cut-off for the telescope that we have to close the dome and stop observing because high wind can potentially damage the mirror.

## Career Advice
- **[Postdoctoral Application Guidelines](https://jobregister.aas.org/postdoc-application-guidelines)** from AAS Job Register
- **[Unsolicited Advice for Job Applicants](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7tz2r9tonturigk/Application_Advice.pdf)** from [Daniel Green](https://drgreen.physics.ucsd.edu/) which includes guidance on CV, Research Statement, and Letters of Recommendation

## My Volunteer/Outreach Works
- **[MKI Astrogazers](https://astrogazers.mit.edu/)**\\
  We are an outreach group of graduate students mostly in the MIT astrophysics division. We take telescopes around the Cambridge/Boston area to show the cosmos to the public. We also have a solar telescope for daytime observing. 

- **[The Ryerson Astronomical Society](https://astro.uchicago.edu/RAS/)**\\
  I served as a President for the Ryerson Astronomical Society in college from 2012-2014. The main goal for the club is to organize public viewing to observe celestial objects on the roof of our building. 

- **[Community Camp](http://communitycamp.weebly.com/index.html)**\\
  My other interest is about volunteering and education. This website is an example for student camps that I have previously organized and documents related to these activities so that others would be able to do a similar project.

## My Blog
- **[My Blog](http://leogulus-champ.blogspot.com/)** \\
  My personal blog is where I posted mostly about my travel experience, my academic experience with talks and previous conferences, and other non-academic interests like data visualization and geographic information system (GIS).
