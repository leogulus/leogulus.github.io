One example of this misidentified galaxy cluster is the \"Phoenix Cluster\" which discovered recently using the Sunyaevâ€“Zel'dovich effect with the South Pole Telescope. This lead us to question of how many of these nearby galaxy cluster we have been mislabeled in existing all-sky surveys. \r\n\r\n## Other side projects: \r\n * Diagram showing no correlation between Physics GRE scores and GPA or General GRE quantitative section is [here](http://leogulus.github.io/fig.html)\r\n\r\n### The rest is under construction.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
